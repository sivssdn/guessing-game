### Guessing the word

The game is played between two players. The first player thinks of a word, that the second player has to guess the word. The second player can ask up to 20 Yes or No questions, in order to guess the word. The player asking questions can only ask 1 question at a time, and at anytime they can guess the word. 

The game ends when either the second player guesses the word correctly, or after 20 questions have been asked and the correct word hasn’t been guessed.
